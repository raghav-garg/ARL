    //This is still not accurate becasue it assumes that the distribution of requests in previous window is even,
    // which may not be true. But compares to fixed window counter, which only guarantees rate within each window,
    // and sliding window log, which has huge memory footprint, sliding window is more practical.


    //Sliding window counter is similar to fixed window counter but it smooths out bursts of traffic by adding a weighted count in previous window to the count in current window.
    //For example, suppose the limit is 10 per minute. There are 9 requests in window [00:00, 00:01) and 5 reqeuests in window [00:01, 00:02).
    //For a requst arrives at 00:01:15, which is at 25% position of window [00:01, 00:02),
    // we calculate the request count by the formula: 9 x (1 - 25%) + 5 = 11.75 > 10.
    // Thus we reject this request. Even though both windows donâ€™t exceed the limit,
    // the request is rejected because the weighted sum of previous and current window does exceed the limit.
